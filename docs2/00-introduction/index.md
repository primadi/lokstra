description: Overview and entry points for learning Lokstra.

## Welcome

Lokstra is a **Go web framework** that works in two ways:

- **Track 1 – Router**: use Lokstra like **Gin / Echo / Chi** (just routing + middleware).  
- **Track 2 – Application Framework**: use Lokstra like **NestJS / Spring Boot** (services, DI, auto routers, YAML config).

You can start with Track 1 and move to Track 2 later without rewriting everything.
