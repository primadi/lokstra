# Lokstra âš¡

> **Simple. Scalable. Structured.**  
> Lightweight Go backend framework for monoliths and microservices.

## âœ¨ Overview

**Lokstra** is a modular backend framework written in Go, designed for building scalable APIs and backend services with minimal boilerplate. Lokstra supports monolithic and microservice architectures out of the box, with a focus on fast development, clean structure, and runtime flexibility.

Whether you're building a SaaS platform, internal tools, or event-driven systems, Lokstra adapts to your structure â€” not the other way around.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Simple `Server â†’ App â†’ Router` structure with clean lifecycle
- âœ… Supports **multi-binary** and **multi-config** deployment
- âœ… Lightweight & fast routing (uses `httprouter`)
- âœ… **Built-in services**: Logger, DB pool, Redis, Metrics, JWT Auth, etc.
- âœ… Battery-included middleware: recovery, CORS, request logging, etc.
- âœ… Middleware at global, group, and handler levels
- âœ… **Service registry and lifecycle hooks**
- âœ… Extensible: add your own service or middleware easily

	app := &core.App{
		Name: "hello-app",
		Port: 8080,
		Router: func() *core.Router {
			r := core.NewRouter()
			r.Handle("/hello", http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
