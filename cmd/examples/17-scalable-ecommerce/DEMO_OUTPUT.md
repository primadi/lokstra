# 📊 **Configuration Comparison: Monolith vs Microservices**

## 🏢 **Monolith Configuration Output**

```bash
$ $env:DEPLOYMENT_TYPE="monolith"; go run main.go
🏪 Starting E-Commerce Application
🚀 Deployment Type: monolith
🎯 Starting Server: monolith-server
✅ Server monolith-server started successfully!
🌍 Available endpoints:
   GET  /api/products
   POST /api/orders
   GET  /api/users
   POST /api/payments
   GET  /api/analytics

🎉 Application ready! (Press Ctrl+C to stop)
```

### 📋 **Monolith Characteristics**
- ✅ **Single Server**: `monolith-server` on port 8080
- ✅ **All APIs**: Under `/api` prefix  
- ✅ **Shared Resources**: Database, Redis, Email service
- ✅ **High Throughput**: All services in one process
- ✅ **Simple Deployment**: Single binary deployment

---

## 🔄 **Microservices Configuration Output**

### Product Service:
```bash
$ $env:DEPLOYMENT_TYPE="microservices"; $env:SERVER_NAME="product-service"; go run main.go
🏪 Starting E-Commerce Application
🚀 Deployment Type: microservices  
🎯 Starting Server: product-service
✅ Server product-service started successfully!
🌍 Available endpoints:
   GET  /products

🎉 Application ready! (Press Ctrl+C to stop)
```

### Order Service:
```bash
$ $env:DEPLOYMENT_TYPE="microservices"; $env:SERVER_NAME="order-service"; go run main.go
🏪 Starting E-Commerce Application
🚀 Deployment Type: microservices
🎯 Starting Server: order-service
✅ Server order-service started successfully!
🌍 Available endpoints:
   POST /orders

🎉 Application ready! (Press Ctrl+C to stop)
```

### Payment Service:
```bash
$ $env:DEPLOYMENT_TYPE="microservices"; $env:SERVER_NAME="payment-service"; go run main.go
🏪 Starting E-Commerce Application
🚀 Deployment Type: microservices
🎯 Starting Server: payment-service
✅ Server payment-service started successfully!
🌍 Available endpoints:
   POST /payments

🎉 Application ready! (Press Ctrl+C to stop)
```

### 📋 **Microservices Characteristics**
- ✅ **Individual Servers**: Each service on different ports
- ✅ **Focused APIs**: Single domain per service
- ✅ **Isolated Resources**: Separate databases per service  
- ✅ **Independent Scaling**: Scale services individually
- ✅ **Fault Isolation**: Service failures don't affect others

## 🎯 **Key Differences Demonstrated**

| Aspect | Monolith | Microservices |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Deployment** | Single server | Multiple services |
| **Endpoints** | `/api/*` prefix | Root level per service |
| **Configuration** | `config-monolith.yaml` | `config-microservices-*.yaml` |
| **Resource Sharing** | Shared DB/Redis/Email | Isolated per service |
| **Scaling** | Scale entire application | Scale individual services |
| **Development** | Simple deployment | Complex orchestration |
| **Production** | Good for small/medium apps | Good for large/complex apps |

## 📈 **Configuration Highlights**

### **Monolith Config Tuning**
```yaml
# High throughput configuration
configs:
  - name: rate-limit-rps
    value: 1000          # High rate limit
  - name: database-pool-size
    value: 20            # Larger shared pool
  - name: cache-ttl-seconds
    value: 300           # Moderate caching

# Single server with all routers
servers:
  - name: monolith-server
    apps:
      - addr: "/api"
        routers: [product-api, order-api, user-api, payment-api, analytics-api]
```

### **Microservices Config Tuning**

#### Product Service (Heavy Caching):
```yaml
configs:
  - name: rate-limit-rps
    value: 500           # Medium rate limit
  - name: cache-ttl-seconds
    value: 600           # Long cache for product data
  - name: database-url
    value: "postgres://localhost:5432/products"  # Dedicated DB
```

#### Payment Service (High Security):
```yaml
configs:
  - name: rate-limit-rps
    value: 50            # Very low rate for security
  - name: cache-ttl-seconds
    value: 30            # Short cache for payments
  - name: cors-origins
    value: "https://secure.ecommerce.com"  # Strict CORS
```

#### Analytics Service (Heavy Queries):
```yaml
configs:
  - name: database-pool-size
    value: 20            # Large pool for analytics
  - name: cache-ttl-seconds
    value: 1800          # Very long cache for reports
  - name: rate-limit-rps
    value: 100           # Lower rate for complex queries
```

## 🚀 **Production Scenarios**

### **Development Environment** (Monolith)
```bash
# Fast development iteration
export DEPLOYMENT_TYPE=monolith
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://localhost:5432/dev_ecommerce"
go run main.go
# ➡️ Single server with all APIs for rapid development
```

### **Production Environment** (Microservices)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Product Service (Port 8081)
export DEPLOYMENT_TYPE=microservices
export SERVER_NAME=product-service
export PRODUCT_DB_URL="postgres://prod-cluster:5432/products"
go run main.go

# Terminal 2: Order Service (Port 8082)  
export SERVER_NAME=order-service
export ORDER_DB_URL="postgres://prod-cluster:5432/orders"
go run main.go

# Terminal 3: Payment Service (Port 8084)
export SERVER_NAME=payment-service
export PAYMENT_DB_URL="postgres://secure-cluster:5432/payments"
go run main.go

# ➡️ Independent services with dedicated resources
```
