## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Multi-deployment architecture (monolith → microservices)
- Environment-specific configuration strategies
- Configuration validation and testing
- Dynamic configuration updates
- Configuration inheritance patterns
- Secrets management
- Production deployment best practices

---

## 📚 Topics

### 1. Multi-Deployment Architecture
One codebase, multiple deployments:
- Monolith configuration
- Distributed monolith
- Microservices
- Hybrid approaches

### 2. Environment Management
Handle different environments:
- Development, staging, production
- Feature flags
- A/B testing configurations
- Canary deployments

### 3. Configuration Validation
Ensure configuration correctness:
- Schema validation
- Dependency validation
- Runtime validation
- Configuration testing

### 4. Dynamic Configuration
Update configuration at runtime:
- Hot reload strategies
- Configuration watchers
- Feature toggles
- Remote configuration

### 5. Configuration Inheritance
Organize complex configurations:
- Base configurations
- Environment overrides
- Service-specific configs
- Composition patterns

### 6. Secrets Management
Handle sensitive data:
- Environment variables
- Secret stores (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Encryption at rest
- Rotation strategies

### 7. Production Best Practices
Deploy with confidence:
- Configuration versioning
- Rollback strategies
- Configuration monitoring
- Audit logging

## 📂 Examples

All examples are in the `examples/` folder:

### [01 - Monolith to Microservices](examples/01-monolith-to-microservices/)
Same code, different deployment configurations.

### [02 - Environment Management](examples/02-environment-management/)
Handle dev, staging, production environments.

### [03 - Configuration Validation](examples/03-configuration-validation/)
Validate configuration at startup.

### [04 - Dynamic Configuration](examples/04-dynamic-configuration/)
Hot reload and feature flags.

### [05 - Secrets Management](examples/05-secrets-management/)
Integrate with secret stores.

### [06 - Production Patterns](examples/06-production-patterns/)
Real-world production configurations.

## 📖 Prerequisites

Before diving in, make sure you understand:
- [Configuration basics](../../01-essentials/04-configuration/)
- [Environment variables](../../01-essentials/04-configuration/#environment)
- [CFG references](../../01-essentials/04-configuration/#references)

## 🎯 Learning Path

1. **Learn multi-deployment** → Start monolith, plan microservices
2. **Manage environments** → Dev, staging, production
3. **Validate configuration** → Catch errors early
4. **Enable dynamic updates** → Hot reload and feature flags
5. **Organize configs** → Inheritance and composition
6. **Secure secrets** → Integrate secret stores
7. **Deploy to production** → Best practices and patterns

## 💡 Key Takeaways

After completing this section:
- ✅ You'll design flexible deployment strategies
- ✅ You'll manage multiple environments effectively
- ✅ You'll validate configuration at startup
- ✅ You'll update configuration dynamically
- ✅ You'll organize complex configurations
- ✅ You'll secure sensitive data
- ✅ You'll deploy to production confidently

## 🏗️ Architecture Pattern

```
Phase 1: Monolith
└── One binary, all services local

Phase 2: Distributed Monolith  
└── Multiple binaries, same codebase

Phase 3: Microservices
└── Independent services, own databases
```

**Same business logic, different YAML configurations!**
