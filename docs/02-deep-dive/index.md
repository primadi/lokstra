## 🎓 Teaching Philosophy

This section follows these principles:

### 1. **Depth Over Breadth**
Explore each feature thoroughly, including edge cases and gotchas.

### 2. **Production-Focused**
Learn patterns that work at scale, not just toy examples.

### 3. **Performance Aware**
Understand performance implications of different approaches.

### 4. **Real-World Scenarios**
Examples based on actual production use cases.

### 5. **Architecture Patterns**
Learn how to structure large applications.

---

## 📖 How to Use This Section

### Recommended Approach (4-6 hours):
```
Week 1: Router + Service Deep Dive      (2.5-3 hours)
Week 2: Middleware + Configuration      (2 hours)
Week 3: App & Server + Practice         (1-2 hours)
```

### Selective Learning:
```
Pick the topics you need:
- Need auto-router? → Service Deep Dive
- Building microservices? → Configuration Deep Dive
- Custom middleware? → Middleware Deep Dive
```

### Complete Mastery (2-3 days):
```
1. Complete all sections in order
2. Run and modify all examples
3. Build a complete microservice architecture
4. Study production deployment patterns
```

---

## 🧪 Running Examples

Every example demonstrates **production-ready patterns**.

### Example structure:
```
01-all-handler-forms/
├── main.go              # Working code
├── README.md            # Pattern explanation
├── test.http            # Test requests
└── benchmarks_test.go   # Performance tests (some examples)
```

### To run an example:
```bash
cd docs/02-deep-dive/01-router/examples/01-all-handler-forms
go run main.go

# Test it
curl http://localhost:3000/endpoint
```

## 🗺️ Advanced Topics Reference

| Topic | What You'll Learn | When You Need It |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| **All Handler Forms** | 29 handler signatures | Choose the right form for your needs |
| **Auto-Router** | Generate routes from services | Reduce boilerplate, enforce conventions |
| **Remote Services** | Service-to-service communication | Microservices architecture |

## 🏗️ Architecture Patterns

### Monolith to Microservices

Learn how to start with a monolith and gradually migrate to microservices **without changing business logic code**:

```
Phase 1: Monolith
└── All services in one binary

Phase 2: Distributed Monolith
└── Multiple binaries, shared database

Phase 3: Microservices
└── Independent services, own databases
```

**Same code, different deployment configurations!**

### Service Communication Patterns

- **Local**: Direct method calls
- **HTTP**: Remote service via REST
- **Proxy**: Transparent local/remote switching

All handled by Lokstra's service layer!
